        Next Steps and Implementation Approach
Completing Phase 2: Book Borrowing and Progress Tracking
These endpoints will round out the core functionality, ensuring users can view their progress and history, and admins can manage books fully.

GET /user-reading-progress

Purpose: Allow authenticated users to view their reading progress for all books (both active and completed).
Implementation Approach:

Authenticate the user via JWT and extract user_id.
Query the ReadingProgress collection for all records matching the user_id.
Optionally join with books collection to include book details (e.g., title, ISBN).
Return a list of progress records, including pages_read, total_pages, reflection, and completed status.
Handle pagination if the user has many records.
Return 401 for unauthenticated users, 403 for unverified users, or 404 if no progress exists.






GET /user-borrow-history

Purpose: Allow authenticated users to see their borrowing history (past and current borrows).
Implementation Approach:

Authenticate the user via JWT and extract user_id.
Query the BorrowHistory collection for records matching user_id.
Include fields like isbn, title, borrow_date, return_date, and type.
Optionally join with books for additional book details.
Return a sorted list (e.g., by borrow_date descending).
Handle errors similarly to /user-reading-progress.




POST /update-book

Purpose: Allow admins to update book details (e.g., title, location, phone_number_of_the_handler).
Implementation Approach:

Authenticate admin via JWT, ensuring role is "admin".
Parse request body for fields like isbn, title, author, type, physical_location, phone_number_of_the_handler, softcopy_url, about_the_book.
Validate inputs (e.g., ensure isbn exists, phone_number_of_the_handler for hardcopy).
Update the matching book in the books collection using isbn or _id.
Return 200 on success, 400 for invalid input, 403 for non-admins, or 404 if book not found.




DELETE /delete-book

Purpose: Allow admins to delete a book from the system.
Implementation Approach:

Authenticate admin via JWT, ensuring role is "admin".
Parse request body for isbn or book _id.
Check if the book exists and is not currently borrowed (available: true).
Delete the book from the books collection.
Optionally cascade delete related Reading, BorrowHistory, or ReadingProgress records.
Return 200 on success, 400 for invalid input, 403 for non-admins, or 404 if book not found.





Phase 3: Social Features and Gamification
These endpoints introduce social engagement and gamification to make the platform more interactive.

GET /public-reviews

Purpose: Display approved reviews for a specific book or all books, accessible to all users (no authentication required).
Implementation Approach:

Optionally parse query parameter for isbn to filter by book.
Query the Reviews collection for records where posted: true.
Join with users (for reviewer’s name or reader_id) and books (for book details).
Sort by created_at or upvotes for relevance.
Return a list of reviews with review_text, ai_score, upvotes, etc.
Handle cases where no reviews exist (return empty array).




POST /upvote-review

Purpose: Allow authenticated users to upvote approved reviews.
Implementation Approach:

Authenticate user via JWT, ensuring verified: true.
Parse request body for review_id.
Validate that the review exists and is posted (posted: true).
Prevent users from upvoting their own reviews (check user_id).
Increment the upvotes field in the Reviews collection.
Return 200 on success, 400 for invalid review_id, or 403 for unauthorized actions.




GET /leaderboard

Purpose: Display a ranked list of users based on rank_score (publicly accessible).
Implementation Approach:

Query the users collection, sorting by rank_score descending.
Limit to top N users (e.g., 10) and select fields like name, reader_id, rank_score, books_read.
Optionally filter by class_tag or insa_batch for specific leaderboards.
Return 200 with the ranked list, or empty array if no users.




GET /user-profile

Purpose: Allow users to view their own profile, including badges, reading stats, and progress.
Implementation Approach:

Authenticate user via JWT and extract user_id.
Query users for user details (name, reader_id, books_read, rank_score).
Query ReadingProgress and Badges collections for user-specific data.
Aggregate stats (e.g., total pages read, completed books).
Return a structured response with profile details, or 403/404 for errors.




POST /award-badge

Purpose: Allow admins to award badges to users for achievements (e.g., reading milestones).
Implementation Approach:

Authenticate admin via JWT, ensuring role is "admin".
Parse request body for user_id, badge_name, and optional description.
Insert a new record into the Badges collection (you’ll need to define this collection).
Optionally update user’s rank_score based on badge value.
Return 201 on success, 400 for invalid input, or 403 for non-admins.





Phase 4: Recommendations and Advanced Features
These endpoints add value through personalized recommendations and motivational content.

GET /recommendations

Purpose: Suggest books to users based on their reading history or preferences.
Implementation Approach:

Authenticate user via JWT and extract user_id.
Query Reading or BorrowHistory to analyze user’s past reads (e.g., genres, authors).
Implement a simple recommendation logic (e.g., books by same author, similar about_the_book keywords).
Query books for available books matching criteria.
Return a list of recommended books, or empty array if none.




GET /quotes

Purpose: Display inspirational reading quotes (publicly accessible).
Implementation Approach:

Query the Quotes collection (you’ll need to define this collection).
Randomly select or filter quotes (e.g., by category or author).
Return a list of quotes with text, author, etc.
Handle empty cases gracefully.




POST /add-quote

Purpose: Allow admins to add new inspirational quotes.
Implementation Approach:

Authenticate admin via JWT, ensuring role is "admin".
Parse request body for text, author, and optional metadata.
Insert into Quotes collection.
Return 201 on success, 400 for invalid input, or 403 for non-admins.






How to Approach Implementation

Database Setup:

Create new collections (Badges, Quotes) if not already defined.
Update models/user.go to include Badges and Quotes structs.
Add indexes for new collections (e.g., user_id in Badges, author in Quotes).


Handler Development:

Create a new handlers/misc.go for non-book-related endpoints (e.g., leaderboard, quotes).
Follow the same pattern as existing handlers: authenticate via JWT, validate inputs, query MongoDB, handle errors.
Use existing BookHandler and AuthHandler as templates for consistency.


Testing:

Update Postman collection with new endpoints.
Test each endpoint with valid and invalid inputs (e.g., missing JWT, invalid isbn).
Verify database updates (e.g., check upvotes increment, new badge in Badges).


Error Handling:

Return appropriate HTTP status codes (200, 201, 400, 401, 403, 404).
Provide clear error messages in JSON responses.


Security:

Ensure admin-only endpoints (/update-book, /delete-book, /award-badge, /add-quote) check for role: admin.
Validate user inputs to prevent injection or invalid data.




Recommendations

Start with Phase 2: Implement /user-reading-progress and /user-borrow-history first, as they’re natural extensions of your current functionality and leverage existing collections (ReadingProgress, BorrowHistory).
Move to Phase 3: Focus on /public-reviews and /upvote-review to add social engagement, as these build on the existing Reviews collection.
Phase 4 Later: Tackle /recommendations last, as it requires more complex logic (e.g., analyzing user history).
Prioritize Database Setup: Define Badges and Quotes collections early if you plan to implement /award-badge or /quotes.

This approach keeps you moving incrementally while building on your existing code. Let me know if you want guidance on specific endpoints as you code them, or if you need help with testing or debugging! Happy coding!
Current Project Context
Based on your implemented routes, I assume your project has a structure similar to this:

main.go: Entry point, sets up the router, MongoDB connection, and initializes handlers.
handlers/auth.go: Contains authentication-related handlers (Register, Login, ApproveUser).
handlers/book.go: Contains book-related handlers (AddBook, ListAllBooks, ListAvailableBooks, BorrowBook, ReturnBook, UpdateReadingProgress, SubmitReview, ApproveReview, AddSoftToReading).
models/user.go: Defines data models (User, PendingRegistration, Book, BorrowHistory, ReadingProgress, Review, Reading).
MongoDB database: reading_tracker with collections (users, pending_registrations, books, BorrowHistory, ReadingProgress, Reviews, Reading).

You’re now adding endpoints for:

Phase 2: /user-reading-progress, /user-borrow-history, /update-book, /delete-book.
Phase 3: /public-reviews, /upvote-review, /leaderboard, /user-profile, /award-badge.
Phase 4: /recommendations, /quotes, /add-quote.

These require new models (Badges, Quotes) and handlers, so let’s plan the project structure to accommodate them.
